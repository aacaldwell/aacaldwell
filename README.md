- 👋 Hi, I’m @aacaldwell
- 👀 I’m interested in operating system development. I have a couple of small projects where I am learning how to setup a custom kernel and a custom c library in pure C/Assembly targeting x86 and x86_64. I also have another unfinished os project targeting Swift runtime. My latest project involves creating a a compiler to be used for assembling the kernel development together.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning cyber security fundamentals, specifically in areas of exploit development and penetration testing. I hope to create my own scripts and libraries to further my red teaming skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on compiler constructions, symbolic execution, fuzzing projects, exploit development if possible, and os development.
